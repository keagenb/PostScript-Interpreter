    When you type input into this interpreter, it is parsed (read) into an expression. 
    This expression is represented in our code as an instance of this `Expr` class.
    In our interpreter, there are five types of expressions:
        1.	Literal:  represents primitive constants : integers or booleans . The `value` attribute contains the fixed value the `Literal` refers to. 
        2.	Name: represents names of variables, functions, or operators .  The `var_name` attribute contains the name of the variable as a Python string, e.g., '/sq','sq','add','def'. If the `var_name` starts with a `/` character, Name represents a name constant, otherwise it represents a variable reference ,  function call, or a built-in operator call. 
        3.	Array: represents arrays.  The `value` attribute is a Python list that includes the elements of the PostScript array it represents, e.g., [Literal(1),Name(x), Literal(2), Literal(3), Name(y),Name(add)] 
        4.	Block: represents body of a function or if, ifelse, or for expressions. The `value` attribute is a Python list that includes the tokens of the PostScript code-array (block) it represents [Literal(10), Literal(5),Name(mul)]
    In our code, the four types of expressions are subclasses of the `Expr`
    class: `Literal`, `Name`, `Array`, and `Block`.
