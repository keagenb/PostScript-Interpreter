# PostScript-Interpreter

Created in the Fall of 2022 for Computer Science 355 - Programming Language Deisgn. With sample code and guidance through lecture students implemented an interpreter
in Python that could read PostScript operations. For the final project options for both static and dynamic linking were added to test and understand different stack operations.

Running 'python load.py' will loop through all sample tests and provide the output for both static and dynamic at every test.
Running 'python reply.py' will allow user to freely enter PostScript code and run their own tests.
